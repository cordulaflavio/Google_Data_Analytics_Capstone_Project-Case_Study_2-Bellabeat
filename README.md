### Case Study info:

- Bellabeat, is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Ur코ka Sr코en, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.

- In a nutshel (and assuming I work for Bellabeat), the task here is to identify consumption patterns in users of FitBit products that can support the Bellabeat's Marketing strategy. 

- The dataset used in this Case Study can be accessed via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) and correspond to data of a Smartwatch with personal fitness information such heart rate, calories, etc.

- This Case Study follows the six data analysis phases designed by Google and makes use of PostgreSQL and Tableau.
